---------------------Blocked vs Dependent--------------------------------
foo depends on bar
foo is blocked by baz

One way of reading it is as:

Foo cannot be started until bar is completed
Foo was started but baz happened (an external factor, probably) and it's 
blocking it's progress

Which could be derived into:

Depends are used for known or planned activities
Blocks are used for unexpected activities

----------------------Voting------------------------------------
Voting is a means of gathering feedback from users on the relative importance of the issue 
to the wider user base. The more votes the more important. 
Each user has 1 vote per issue. This feedback can then be used by 
product teams / service teams to help prioritize the issue.

-----------------------Linked Issues--------------------------
Issue linking allows you to create an association between two existing issues on either
 the same or different Jira servers. 
 For example: An issue may relate to another. An issue may duplicate another.
 
-----------------------Watching------------------------------------
Watching means you receive notifications when things happen on an issue. 
For example, when someone comments on, edits, or transitions the issue, 
you'll be notified.

--------------------------FixVersions------------------------------
Although it can be useful for tracking problems, it isn't used very often in Jira. 
Fix version is the version where you plan on releasing a feature 
or bugfix to customers. This field is used for release planning, 
monitoring progress and velocity, and is used widely in reporting. 
This is most likely the field you want.

-----------------------AffectedVersion--------------------------
Affects version is the version in which a bug or problem was found. 
Although it can be useful for tracking problems, 
it isn't used very often in Jira. Fix version is the version where 
you plan on releasing a feature or bugfix to customers.
