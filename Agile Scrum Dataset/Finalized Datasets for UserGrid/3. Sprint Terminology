----------------Issues Not Complete--------------
Any issues not completed at the end of the sprint will be moved to the next planned sprint, 
as they did not meet the team's definition of "Done". 
If you do not have a next planned sprint, 
they will be returned to the backlog and will be 
visible in the Backlog of the board.

--------------Issues completed in an sprint--------------------------
A board filters for a set of issues. A sprint includes a sub-set of those issues, 
the ones you have chosen to work on for the sprint. 
If you take an issue that is not included in the current sprint, 
and complete it while the sprint is running, then,
well it is an "issue complete outside a sprint".
